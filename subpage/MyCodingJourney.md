## From Medicine to Code: My Coding Journey 

  This personal homepage is my first work to code.

### 1. Udemy Web Development Bootcamp Project - Dice Game | HTML, CSS, JS (10.2024)

- Developed an interactive dice game, allowing two players to roll dice and display the winner based on random dice rolls.
- Implemented JS to generate random numbers, update DOM elements using querySelector() and setAttribute(), and dynamically display the result using If statements.
- Project repository: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/zkManuel0123/Udemy-Course-Project)
