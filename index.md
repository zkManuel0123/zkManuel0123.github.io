### About me

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Automation from HFUT and a Master’s degree in Medical Technology with a specialization in Medical Informatics and Artificial Intelligence from Technical University of Darmstadt. Prior to this, I also obtained a Master's degree in Medicine from Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, driven by my curiosity about medicine. I believe medicine should not be passive, but rather empowered by AI to proactively serve human health. Therefore, exploring the boundaries of AI capabilities is crucial for humanity.

My current research focuses on developing reliable and adaptive AI agent systems, with emphasis on generalizability, autonomous open-ended problem-solving. I am particularly interested in how autonomous agents can collaborate, plan, and make decisions in complex environments such as medicine, scientific research, and data-driven discovery. My broader goal is to design intelligent, interpretable, and safe agentic systems capable of assisting humans in scientific reasoning, clinical decision-making, and knowledge synthesis. I am exploring various aspects of AI agent frameworks, aiming to advance next-generation agentic AI that combines cognitive flexibility with trustworthiness.
